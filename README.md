# CLV-RFM-Analysis
# 🎯 Customer LifeTine Value and Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value

## 🔍 Overview
This project aims to provide a refined Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis using cohort analysis, addressing limitations of the standard Shopify CLV formula. The analysis includes all website visitors, not just purchasing customers, and tracks their spending behavior over a 12-week period. By calculating average revenue per user (ARPU) for each cohort and projecting future revenue using cumulative growth percentages, this analysis offers a more accurate understanding of customer value over time. Key insights focus on identifying revenue growth trends, forecasting future CLV, and understanding long-term customer behavior.
